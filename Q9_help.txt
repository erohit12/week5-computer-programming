Question9: 

prompt = "> "
secret_word = "TIGER"
user = ""

while user != secret_word:
    print("Please enter a five letter word ")
    user = (input(prompt)).upper()
    
    #How do I compare values and index values of secret_word and user? 
    # Haha ok, i would do something like this:
    for position, character in enumerate(user): # Basically what this does is a for loop that gives you index (position) and value of every character
    # So for example if your word is ABCDE, it will give 0,'A' then 1,'B', etc
    # You can use that to then do the same for the secret_word string, and explore it the same way
    # Then you find if the indexes matched (perfect match) or if it matched at least once somewhere
